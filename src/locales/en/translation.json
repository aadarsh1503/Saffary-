  "storyContent1": "In the year 2019 our founder Vineet Singh Kashyap met with an accident with our local chaiwala vendor as he was not able to deliver tea in our office on time. On the same day Vineet asked him about his concerns and decided to build a tech based platform for him so that chaiwala can manage his deliveries smoothly",
  "storyContent2": "As soon as Vineet started with the road map COVID-19 hit the global market and almost all offices got closed. But the problem of chaiwala was so real that in COVID times only Vineet started working on its planning",
  "storyContent3": "Vineet wanted to keep a simple but easy to recall brand name and one day he came across a very trending word ‘CORONA’ in COVID times and from that he planned to name this product as Saffary and gave tagline as Saffary se order Saffary na!’.",
  "storyContent4": "When Vineet was working on this product he realised that this is a common problem for everyone who is going to the office on a daily basis and if they want to order anything along with tea/coffee then they don’t have any option by calling local merchants and asking to deliver product in their office",
  "storyContent5": "Considering all these factors we decided to focus on instant food delivery along with tea-coffee.",
  "storyContent6": "In the month of Dec 2021 most of the offices got started and we were also ready with MVP version of Mobile App so started approaching nearby merchants to onboard them on our platform. But unfortunately considering the new concept no merchant has shown any interest in our product and we were not able to onboard any merchant by mid of Feb 2022.",
